ChipApplication
===============

Flex application that can connect to a server, receives a number from this one, and displays it as stacks of chip.

##Instruction

To run properly this application, you first need to run the server on your localhost.
You can get it at https://github.com/poloop/NodeServerNumberGenerator

Once you launch the server you can launch the application and connect it.


##Credits

That application use 3 libraries.

_ xhr-polling-as3 by Sean Quinlan : https://github.com/sbquinlan/AS3-Socket.IO-XHR-Polling
 That library affords me to connect the application whit socket.io server.
 
_ robotlegs 1.4 : https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-framework
 MVC framework
 
_ as3-signals by Robert Penner : https://github.com/robertpenner/as3-signals
